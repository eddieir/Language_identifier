He
is
soft
like
child
have
to
be
careful
not
to
press
too
hard
or
hold
too
tight
and
am
constantly
careful
the
way
you
have
to
be
careful
to
not
touch
the
soft
spot
on
baby’s
head
Everything
has
to
be
lukewarm
mellow
muffled
bathe
him
with
water
that
is
close
to
the
temperature
of
blood
don’t
want
to
surprise
his
body
with
something
too
starkly
different
My
spine
makes
popping
sounds
and
my
blood
rushes
to
my
head
and
makes
it
pound
painfully
when
bend
down
to
soap
his
feet
but
can
still
stand
and
he
cannot
which
is
why
I’m
the
one
sliding
my
soapy
fingers
between
his
toes
even
though
he
doesn’t
really
go
anywhere
barefoot
He
doesn’t
really
go
anywhere
His
skin
feels
thin
like
the
yellowed
paper
in
old
books
and
think
that
maybe
if
scrub
too
hard
will
scour
it
right
off
his
bones
His
bones
feel
oddly
close
to
the
surface
of
his
body
as
if
his
blood
and
flesh
have
been
compressed
into
thinner
layers
the
way
layers
of
rock
are
under
the
surface
of
the
earth
He
looks
like
wet
cat
sitting
there
on
chair
under
the
shower
cold
and
scared
looking
with
his
hair
all
clumped
together
in
places
turn
off
the
water
and
go
to
get
towel
Sometimes
am
asked
why
don’t
hire
nurse
Nurses
won’t
understand
him
like
do
We
met
at
university
He
was
studying
psychology
and
was
toiling
through
English
We
made
each
other
happy
because
we
could
at
least
construct
nice
sepia
toned
image
of
home
in
our
minds
if
not
of
jobs
and
something
is
always
better
than
drawing
blank
started
wearing
lipstick
and
he
bought
white
dress

and
we
made
pretty
picture
with
the
one
foot
Memon
difference
between
our
heights
My
head
came
up
to
his
chest
and
could
hear
his
heart
beating
when
we
hugged
We
would
sit
together
in
silence
and
read
books
We
compared
the
chinks
and
crevices
in
our
families
We
built
an
impenetrable
fort
around
heartbeats
and
shared
books
and
common
family
problems
and
he
told
me
how
he
missed
his
grandmother
and
told
him
that
my
favourite
flowers
are
frangipanis
“Shaadi
ke
baarey
mein
kya
khayaal
hai?”
he
asked
one
day
as
he
rifled
through
textbook
looking
for
page
of
notes
Silences
weren’t
too
uncomfortable
with
him
our
parents
knew
about
us
and
we
had
taken
so
many
hours
away
from
other
things
and
given
them
to
each
other
Everything
added
up
We
were
about
to
graduate
and
was
soon
going
to
be
twenty
six
and
too
old
“Bura
khayaal
nahi
hai
”
said
Later
wore
my
lipstick
and
he
wore
his
dress
shirt
we
went
out
to
dinner
and
he
gave
me
dozen
red
roses
Frangipanis
don’t
come
in
bouquets
he
told
me
Our
wedding
was
glorious
He
was
neatly
boxed
up
in
black
suit
trimmed
with
red
tie
that
matched
almost
perfectly
with
the
red
of
my
lehnga
Shiny
little
silver
sequins
covered
my
clothes
and
threw
off
light
making
grey
spots
dance
on
the
side
of
his
suit
that
faced
me
drew
calibrated
appropriate
breaths
and
felt
as
if
rock
was
stuck
at
the
top
of
the

Memon
“Piled
on
the
makeup
haven’t
they
”
he
said
when
sat
down
next
to
him
and
gave
me
halfsmile
and
the
kind
of
up
and
down
look
you
would
give
your
car
after
it
has
had
paint
job
“I’ll
have
so
much
to
take
off
tonight
”
said
and
tried
not
to
let
my
teeth
show
as
smiled
because
brides
don’t
have
teeth
only
lips
The
straps
of
my
shoes
dug
into
my
feet
and
my
toes
felt
sweaty
so
tried
to
lift
them
off
the
satin
soles
of
my
shoes
so
that
they
wouldn’t
leave
wet
toe
prints
but
my
toes
were
strapped
down
as
well
My
mother
told
me
made
beautiful
bride
She
was
right
The
dents
beneath
my
cheekbones
had
been
coloured
in
darker
and
my
lips
were
painted
purple
red
the
colour
of
deoxygenated
blood
in
school
textbooks
and
my
eyelashes
were
so
long
that
they
would
have
become
squashed
up
against
the
lenses
in
my
spectacles
had
been
wearing
them
He
looked
beautiful
too
all
angles
and
clean
lines
with
his
neatly
trimmed
beard
and
neatly
cut
hair
and
squared
shoulders
and
smile
with
his
perfectly
aligned
grid
of
teeth
“Idhar
dekhiye
”
the
photographer
said
shining
light
on
our
faces
bright
enough
to
light
up
stadium
We
smiled
With
our
perfect
hair
and
manufactured
smiles
we
were
the
picture
the
photographer
would
tape
to
the
counter
in
his
shop
and
show
to
people
who
wanted
their
wedding
pictures
taken
Memon
With
the
mathematical
precision
with
which
we
were
progressing
became
pregnant
in
the
second
year
of
our
marriage
It
was
easy
and
peaceful
and
the
only
pain
felt
was
similar
to
the
growing
pains
had
when
was
twelve
dull
not
too
unpleasant
ache
and
sense
of
something
in
me
stretching
outwards
slowly
became
rounder
softer
around
the
edges
with
the
angles
of
my
hipbones
and
collarbones
disappearing
under
flesh
Sometimes
discomfort
would
settle
in
but
would
ignore
it
the
way
you
ignore
the
little
bit
of
blood
you
sometimes
draw
when
you
brush
your
teeth
We
bought
little
blue
clothes
and
blue
woolen
shoes
and
blue
teddy
bears
for
our
son
who
would
probably
outgrow
all
those
little
clothes
in
less
time
than
it
would
take
for
him
to
be
born
took
care
of
myself
the
way
would
take
care
not
to
bang
my
knee
against
the
side
table
when
got
out
of
bed
and
he
took
care
of
me
the
way
people
who
are
afraid
to
pick
up
children
worry
about
them
from
afar
We
would
sleep
with
strip
of
empty
bed
sheet
between
us
and
would
wake
up
slowly
and
quietly
during
the
night
careful
not
to
wake
him
up
One
night
woke
up
with
jolt
followed
by
the
feeling
of
being
frightened
by
dream
didn’t
even
remember
had
wet
the
bed
swung
my
legs
over
the
side
of
the
bed
and
carefully
lowered
myself
onto
the
floor
Warm
wet
lines
came
down
my
legs
and
felt
my
face
go
hot
in
the
dark
turned
on
the
light
and
walked
to
the
bathroom
and
it
was
as
closed
the
bathroom
door
that
happened
to
glance
at
my
feet
and
saw
irregular
lines
on
them
that
looked
like
rivers
on
map
except
that
they
were
darkening
red
took
off
my
clothes
and
saw
clots
forming
on
my
wet
legs
and
may
have
gasped
or
screamed
but
all
remember
from
that
night
is
muffled
and
coloured
fluorescent
white
like
the
light
in
the
bathroom
and
red
washed
off
Memon
the
red
in
the
shower
and
couldn’t
find
towel
so
put
clean
clothes
on
my
shower
wet
body
and
walked
back
into
the
room
He
stirred
as
opened
the
bathroom
door
and
opened
his
eyes
squinting
at
me
dark
shape
coloured
the
sheets
where
was
supposed
to
lie
shivered
in
the
cold
of
the
fan
and
couldn’t
stop
shivering
and
stared
at
the
stain
as
if
wasn’t
sure
how
it
got
there
He
looked
at
it
too
except
that
he
seemed
to
know
what
it
was
while
wasn’t
even
sure
if
was
awake
He
stripped
the
sheets
and
put
them
in
plastic
bag
which
he
put
in
the
bin
He
laid
down
clean
white
sheet
fluorescent
and
unmarked
“We
should
go
to
the
hospital
”
he
said
“Soney
dou
mujhe
need
to
sleep
”
said
was
shivering
and
drew
the
sheets
around
myself
and
tucked
them
under
me
and
moved
away
when
he
tried
to
move
close
to
me
told
him
that
needed
to
sleep
He
told
me
to
suit
myself
Everything
was
white
and
clean
in
the
morning
and
wondered
if
had
had
bad
dream
But
the
rock
between
my
lungs
seemed
to
have
settled
somewhere
below
my
stomach
and
the
maasi
who
cleaned
our
house
looked
at
me
with
round
eyes
and
arched
eyebrows
and
offered
to
make
me
tea
The
dustbin
in
our
room
was
empty
and
the
bathroom
floor
was
wet
and
unblemished
white
He
came
back
late
at
night
and
had
puffy
crescents
pink
and
grey
under
his
eyes
asked
him
where
he
had
gone
especially
after
last
night
He
told
me
he
needed
to
get
out
of
the
house
and
that
he
had
had
dinner
from
outside
so
needn’t
worry
Memon
slowly
started
noticing
the
ridges
of
my
collarbones
pressing
against
my
skin
The
soft
roundness
was
gone
There
were
more
times
when
would
become
aware
of
the
rock
between
my
lungs
and
then
there
were
times
when
felt
the
kind
of
comfortable
you
feel
at
dawn
on
weekend
in
winters
when
you
wake
up
and
know
that
you
have
hours
more
to
sleep
in
the
soft
warmth
of
your
blankets
and
you
don’t
have
to
wake
up
until
you
wake
up
yourself
But
then
nobody
ever
does
let
you
sleep
that
long
Marriage
and
what
comes
with
it
causes
thinning
of
the
boundaries
that
you
carefully
draw
between
yourself
and
your
violation
Before
there
are
layers
of
clothes
and
rules
He
had
never
heard
my
heart
beating
because
his
face
would
have
been
too
close
to
my
chest
After
there
are
only
thin
moist
membranes
that
separate
the
body
that
you
so
arrogantly
believe
to
be
yours
alone
from
everything
that
threatens
to
take
ownership
away
from
you
Suddenly
the
difference
in
our
heights
was
twelve
inches
too
many
and
six
and
half
inches
would
leave
me
sore
and
unsure
and
filled
with
an
uncomfortable
heat
and
cold
that
was
so
cold
it
burned
The
makeup
on
my
dresser
multiplied
had
different
kinds
for
painting
on
over
the
blues
and
reds
and
all
their
shades
that
he
would
leave
on
my
skin
But
his
antiseptic
aftershave
smell
would
cling
to
me
even
after
showered
My
body
had
so
easily
with
one
gush
of
fluid
cheated
him
out
of
family
It
refused
to
even
try
again
It
was
not
me
he
hated
it
was
my
treacherous
body
didn’t
know
how
to
stop
him
and
Memon
knew
he
still
loved
me
and
maybe
this
was
him
taking
comfort
in
me
in
the
only
way
he
remembered
Time
was
kind
to
my
body
but
it
seemed
to
hate
his
so
his
body
gave
up
on
him
He
stopped
Like
car
without
wheels
standing
on
four
bricks
he
no
longer
went
anywhere
not
even
behind
my
thin
layers
Outside
the
bathroom
pass
by
the
chest
of
drawers
with
the
towels
in
it
and
pick
up
my
mug
of
tea
which
has
become
cold
in
the
time
that
was
bathing
him
turn
on
the
television
in
the
bedroom
and
sip
my
tea
and
close
the
windows
against
the
winter
evening
There
are
still
twenty
minutes
to
the
hourly
news
so
turn
off
the
television
and
hear
my
name
being
called
in
faltering
falsetto
finish
my
tea
and
pick
up
towel
from
the
drawer
and
walk
into
the
bathroom
He
looks
at
me
with
his
muggy
eyes
and
wheezes
and
water
drips
from
the
soggy
clumps
of
his
white
hair
His
fingers
which
grip
the
handles
of
his
chair
are
pale
white
and
his
lips
are
faintly
blue
“Kahaan
thee?
I’m

around

Title:
The
Pastoral
Symphony
is
study
in
self
deception
Discuss
Student:
Amina
Raza
Instructor

Rehan
Course
Heroines:Through
the
ages
the
French
novel
from
Raza
The
Pastoral
Symphony
is
an
ironical
novel
written
as
book
of
criticism
and
one
of
it’s
greatest
criticisms
seems
to
be
the
conduct
of
the
Pastor
character
who
is
not
only
immoral
inconsiderate
and
selfish
but
is
also
harsh
judgmental
hypocrite
of
man
The
Pastor’s
continued
inconsiderate
behavior
even
in
the
face
of
the
immorality
and
injustice
of
his
actions
is
Raza
the
height
of
blindness
and
although
Gertrude
is
the
one
who
is
physically
blind
the
Pastor’s
self
deception
leaves
him
as
the
one
who
is
truly
blind
The
first
aspect
of
self
deception
in
the
novel
arises
from
the
Pastor’s
status
as
pastor:
man
of
religion
The
Pastor
chooses
to
believe
what
he
wants
in
spite
of
being
Pastor
he
believes
in
some
parts
of
the
Bible
and
conveniently
avoids
others
showing
that
even
his
faith
is
one
of
ignorance
and
convenience
Arthur
E
Babcock
asserts
that
“The
pastor’s
dishonesty
is
to
have
performed
false
reading
of
the
testament”
(Babcock
The
Pastor
in
his
diary
explicitly
asks
himself
“It
is
diminishing
profaning
the
Gospel
to
see
in
it
above
all
method
for
attaining
the
happy
life”
(Gide
illustrating
how
he
consciously
chooses
to
think
only
of
verses
that
reflect
on
the
innocence
of
love
and
not
on
verses
that
condemn
adultery
and
sin
In
spite
of
being
Pastor
and
being
well
aware
of
what
Christianity
thinks
of
adultery
and
fornication
the
Pastor
not
only
has
an
extra
marital
affair
but
sexually
exploits
minor
and
blind
girl
at
that
girl
who
asks
him
“Then
you
admit
our
love
is
outside
the
laws
of
God”
(Gide
and
still
fails
to
awaken
any
regret
within
him
as
he
in
response
asks
“You
think
your
love
is
wrong?”
the
“Your”
instead
of
“our”
allowing
him
to
effectively
disassociate
with
what
is
perceived
to
be
wrong
here
The
worrisome
truth
is
that
the
Pastor
is
knowledgeable
of
his
despicable
nature
of
his
actions
and
it
is
assertions
like
the
one
mentioned
above
that
makes
one
realize
that
his
reluctance
to
realize
that
what
he
is
doing
goes
against
everything
religion
stands
for
is
an
act
of
active
self
deception
Another
aspect
of
the
Pastor’s
self
deception
and
hypocrisy
is
his
anger
over
Jacques’s
affection
for
Gertrude
anger
that
he
interprets
as
concern
while
it
is
in
fact
jealousy
“I
will
not
suffer
you
to
speak
to
her
to
touch
her
to
see
her
for
one
single
day
more”(Gide
are
his
exact
words
to
Jacques
words
that
effectively
illustrate
that
the
Pastor’s
feelings
for
Gertrude
are
Raza
in
fact
those
of
lover
and
his
reaction
exhibits
his
jealousy
over
Jacques
even
touching
Gertrude
Similarly
“Was
it
not
in
itself
strange
that
she
should
accept
instructions
and
guidance
from
him
when
she
had
previously
refused
them
from
me
preferring
she
said
to
practice
by
herself?
was
more
astonished
more
pained
than
liked
to
own”
(Gide
the
words
“More
pained
than
liked
to
own”
again
showing
his
awareness
of
his
feelings
yet
his
insistence
upon
deceiving
himself
The
height
of
hypocrisy
is
shown
when
the
Pastor
says:
“To
abuse
infirmity
innocence
candour!”
(Gide
to
Jacques
when
it
is
evident
that
Jacques
feels
genuine
affection
and
love
for
Gertrude
and
wishes
to
marry
her
and
enter
into
legitimate
and
respectable
relationship
yet
this
is
regarded
as
an
abuse
of
innocence
by
the
Pastor
in
contrast
to
his
own
extra
marital
adultery
with
the
child
The
Pastor’s
self
deception
is
not
limited
to
the
immorality
of
his
affair
with
Gertrude
he
is
equally
ignorant
to
the
suffering
of
his
wife
and
son
because
of
him
In
the
beginning
of
the
novel
readers
are
introduced
to
the
Pastor’s
wife
as
housewife
with
many
children
who
has
her
hands
full
with
work
yet
she
dutifully
does
it
The
Pastor
brings
filthy
stranger
into
the
woman’s
home
and
after
thrusting
the
vermin
covered
girl
onto
his
wife
demands
that
he
clean
her
He
is
inconsiderate
to
the
extra
work
he
is
creating
for
his
already
strained
wife
and
in
spite
of
her
occasional
complaints
he
is
aware
of
her
dutiful
nature
and
is
not
at
all
uncomfortable
in
abusing
it
for
his
own
benefit
Even
when
the
woman
cleans
the
filthy
girl
allows
her
to
live
in
her
house
with
her
children
and
feeds
and
clothes
her
her
occasional
legitimate
protests
over
the
lack
of
attention
the
Pastor
gives
to
his
own
children
in
comparison
to
Gertrude
are
met
with
comments
such
as
“I
most
suffered
from
her
reproaches”
(Gide
showing
the
Pastor’s
willingness
to
cast
himself
as
poor
victim
of
vindictive
reproaches
from
his
inconsiderate
wife
Similarly
the
Pastor
is
well
aware
of
the
genuine
nature
of
Jacques’s
feelings
for
Gertrude
but
he
Raza
does
not
care
at
all
about
his
son’s
feelings
He
is
well
aware
of
his
son’s
nature
the
boy
never
required
scolding
or
chastising
from
his
father
and
surely
the
father’s
vehement
exclamations
that
he
stay
away
from
Gertrude
deter
him
from
maintaining
any
notions
of
marrying
her
This
is
another
example
of
the
Pastor’s
ignorance
of
another
person’s
feelings
in
favor
of
his
personal
gain
and
his
callous
and
cruel
response
to
their
suffering
heart
that
is
so
cold
to
his
own
wife
and
his
son
his
flesh
and
blood
that
it
too
seems
blind
The
Pastor
also
fools
himself
with
delusions
of
honor
and
duty
when
concerning
his
affair
with
Gertrude
“If
did
not
already
love
her
it
would
be
my
duty
to
love
her
for
pity’s
sake
to
cease
to
love
her
would
be
to
betray
her;
she
needs
my
love
”
(Gide
is
an
example
of
the
Pastor’s
opinion
of
his
feelings
for
her
and
how
important
they
are
The
Pastor
exploits
Gertrude’s
pitiably
condition
and
relishes
her
dependency
on
him
He
enjoys
creating
world
for
her
when
she
only
knows
that
which
he
tells
her
and
teaches
her
about
and
in
way
he
becomes
her
God
He
fashions
world
for
Gertrude
that
is
just
as
ignorant
of
reality
as
he
is
later
she
regrets
that
he
did
not
tell
her
of
the
sad
and
dismal
realities
of
life
There
are
great
many
things
sad
things
assuredly
that
can’t
see
but
you
have
no
right
to
keep
them
from
me
”
(Gide
Gertrude
tells
him
“The
word
is
not
as
beautiful
as
you
have
made
out”
is
her
main
complaint
and
the
irony
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
girl
who
is
physically
blind
can
still
see
reality
in
way
that
the
Pastor
with
his
sight
years
of
experience
and
knowledge
of
religion
chooses
not
to
see
and
unlike
him
she
does
not
want
to
deceive
herself
“We
can’t
all
be
blind”
(Gide
is
what
Amelie
says
to
the
Pastor
effectively
highlighting
how
everyone
cannot
delude
themselves
to
the
extent
that
the
Pastor
has
somehow
managed
to
complete
with
the
idea
that
his
love
for
Gertrude
is
pure
that
he
is
protecting
her
from
the
harsh
realities
of
life
and
that
in
doing
all
that
he
is
doing
he
is
fulfilling
some
kind
of
duty
he
feels
he
owes
her
Raza
“Ironically
it
is
also
the
text
that
betrays
him”
claims
critic
in
reference
to
the
self
deception
in
The
Pastoral
Symphony
“for
the
self
conscious
elements
of
his
narrative
reveal
it
as
artifice
It
has
been
shown
that
the
pastor’s
claim
of
having
understood
himself
only
upon
reading
the
first
book
cannot
be
accurate
since
the
first
book
contains
references
to
later
understanding”
(Babcock
again
exposing
another
facet
to
the
elaborate
self
deception
that
the
Pastor
participates
in
where
his
writing
shows
that
he
is
conscious
of
his
actions
and
it
is
in
his
active
ignorance
of
them
that
he
in
incriminated
because
that
is
self
deception;
to
know
and
to
pretend
to
not
know
or
to
choose
to
not
acknowledge
The
tragedy
lies
in
the
damage
that
his
actions
cause
to
others
for
all
his
sins
“the
greatest
sin
of
all
the
one
which
caused
the
whole
tragedy
is
the
lack
of
sincerity
on
the
part
of
the
pastor
who
always
lies
to
himself
refuses
to
see
any
eveil
in
his
acts
justifies
himself
by
quoting
the
scriptures
and
even
to
the
end
feels
no
need
for
repenting
It
is
the
pastor’s
self
deceit
which
kills
Gertrude
in
the
end”
(Parnell
It
is
then
that
readers
understand
the
self
deceit
that
pervades
the
novel
and
we
understand
the
significance
of
the
words
“How
happy
men
would
be
if
they
knew
nothing
of
evil!”
(Gide
because
then
they
would
not
have
to
deceive
themselves
to
such
an
extent
in
order
to
sin
and
not
stir
their
conscience
It
is
then
evident
that
The
Pastoral
Symphony
is
indeed
study
in
self
deception
which
is
the
central
premise
of
the
story:
Blindness
physical
and
metaphorical
The
Princess
of
Clèves
Red
and
Black
Dangerous
Liaisons
and
The
Pastoral
Symphony
have
all
dealt
with
women
who
became
attracted
to
men
who
were
not
their
husbands
and
in
the
case
of
Gertrude
from
The
Pastoral
Symphony
their
father
figure
The
characters
of
the
Princess
Madame
de
Rênal
Madame
de
Tourvel
and
Gertrude
are
all
hailed
at
numerous
points
in
their
respective
novels
as
virtuous
and
largely
noble
women
Yet
with
the
exception
of
the
Princess
all
the
other
female
characters
indulge
in
affairs
with
the
men
they
are
attracted
to
when
ironically
it
is
the
Princess
herself
who
can
legitimately
conduct
an
affair
or
even
get
married
to
the
Duke
de
Nemours
at
the
end
of
The
Princess
of
Clèves
due
to
her
husband
s
death
The
Princess
instead
does
not
follow
her
heart
s
desire
and
remains
single
after
the
death
of
the
Prince
of
Clèves
and
spends
part
of
every
year
at
convent
with
the
remainder
of
her
life
being
furnished
with
“inimitable
examples
of
virtue”
(Lafayette
Her
behavior
and
subsequent
end
are
very
different
from
the
other
characters
listed
above
who
all
also
come
ultimately
to
grief
This
difference
is
largely
due
to
the
nature
of
the
Princess
s
character
in
comparison
to
the
other
women
From
the
beginning
of
the
novel
the
reader
is
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
Mademoiselle
de
Chartres
is
“marvelous
beauty”
(Lafayette
who
received
all
praise
with
“noble
modesty”
(Lafayette
Her
beauty
is
so
striking
that
she
soon
has
two
suitors
including
Monsieur
de
Clèves
who
she
eventually
marries
Her
marriage
to
him
is
one
consisting
of
cordiality
and
respect
amongst
the
partners
She
realizes
that
the
Prince
has
“violent
and
restless
passion”
(Lafayette
for
her
while
she
herself
is
accepting
and
appreciative
of
his
love
However
soon
after
her
marriage
she
catches
sight
of
the
“handsomest
man
in
the
world”
(Lafayette
the
Duke
de
Nemours
The
obvious
attraction
between
the
two
then
becomes
the
focus
of
the
novel
Malik
as
the
Princess
tries
to
quash
her
love
for
Nemours
in
her
quest
to
remain
faithful
to
her
husband
Her
attraction
to
the
Duke
is
evident
to
her
mother
whose
dying
words
include
warning
to
the
Princess
that
she
stands
on
the
“edge
of
precipice”
(Lafayette
that
could
endanger
the
reputation
the
Princess
possesses
that
Madame
de
Chartres
so
“ardently
desired”
(Lafayette
for
her
The
Princess
s
evident
commitment
to
this
reputation
and
to
her
own
sense
of
duty
and
piety
lead
her
to
confess
her
attraction
to
Nemours
to
her
husband
in
Part
III
of
the
novel
an
almost
unheard
of
confession
for
the
time
and
one
that
critics
still
question
the
realism
of
After
the
death
of
the
Prince
it
would
appear
that
it
is
again
her
sense
of
duty
and
honor
and
possibly
even
her
own
conception
of
being
above
other
women
who
would
“fall”
(Lafayette
in
such
situation
that
ultimately
compels
her
to
reject
Nemours
and
his
love
Added
to
these
things
are
her
ideas
about
the
Duke
s
own
personality
and
the
fleeting
nature
of
love
after
marriage
One
of
her
main
fears
is
“the
fading
of
his
love
after
marriage”
(Lafayette
and
all
the
“misery
to
which
she
would
expose
herself”
(Lafayette
as
result
of
his
waning
affections
Thus
the
Princess
shows
certain
amount
of
maturity
despite
her
young
age
where
she
not
only
has
high
regard
for
her
duty
to
her
husband
duty
she
carries
on
even
after
his
death
but
she
also
has
good
grasp
of
the
nature
of
love
in
that
society
Love
in
The
Princess
of
Clèves
“was
always
mixed
with
politics
and
politics
with
love”
(Lafayette
and
this
is
lesson
that
the
Princess
learns
through
finding
out
about
various
affairs
at
court
All
these
affairs
serve
as
examples
to
her
about
how
one
s
reputation
is
in
the
hands
of
others
who
can
twist
one
s
affections
to
get
what
they
want
the
most
obvious
example
of
this
being
the
tussle
between
the
Queen
and
the
King’s
mistress
Madame
de
Valentinois
The
Princess
shows
high
regard
for
her
upbringing
and
character
and
learns
from
her
surroundings
and
as
result
of
all
this
she
decides
not
to
give
Malik
in
to
the
man
she
loves
even
when
it
becomes
socially
acceptable
for
her
to
do
so
her
sense
of
duty
and
honor
being
so
ingrained
in
her
In
contrast
Madame
de
Rênal
of
Red
and
Black
submits
easily
and
quickly
to
Julien
Sorel
the
novel
s
main
character
who
initially
strikes
Madame
de
Rênal
as
“little
peasant”
who
looked
like
“girl
in
disguise”
(Stendhal
Julien
s
description
here
is
in
direct
contrast
to
that
of
Monsieur
de
Rênal
who
is
seen
as
boorish
and
crude
Madame
de
Rênal
is
soon
seduced
by
Julien
but
unlike
the
Princess
of
Clèves
she
is
initially
unaware
of
any
wrongdoing
on
her
part
Stendhal
establishes
that
Madame
de
Rênal
forgot
all
that
she
had
learned
in
the
convent
“but
she
put
nothing
in
its
place”
(Stendhal
and
because
of
her
considering
Julien
as
little
more
than
child
she
sees
no
problem
in
giving
in
to
this
young
man
who
is
completely
unlike
her
husband
and
shows
strange
amount
of
passion
and
intelligence
in
his
speech
Eventually
however
“an
instinct
of
virtue”
is
“terrified”
(Stendhal
within
her
over
her
feelings
for
Julien
and
she
considers
the
word
“adultery”
(Stendhal
for
the
first
time
This
leads
her
to
suffer
as
she
considers
telling
her
husband
the
truth
about
her
attraction
to
Julien
However
she
soon
dismisses
this
thought
by
remembering
that
husband
“after
all
is
master”
(Stendhal
and
hence
she
backs
out
of
telling
him
the
truth
In
addition
to
this
Madame
de
Rênal
is
much
simpler
woman
than
the
Princess
of
Clèves
and
she
does
not
possess
the
same
sense
of
duty
to
herself
or
her
husband
that
the
Princess
does
She
fails
to
see
anything
inherently
wrong
in
her
relations
with
Julien
in
the
beginning
and
even
when
she
realizes
that
she
is
effectively
committing
adultery
she
lacks
the
strength
that
the
Princess
has
to
break
with
Julien
as
she
considers
her
life
without
him
as
overall
meaningless
and
thus
she
ultimately
dies
of
grief
after
his
death
Similarly
in
Dangerous
Liaisons
Madame
de
Tourvel
is
hailed
as
an
extremely
virtuous
Malik
woman
It
is
in
fact
her
virtue
that
leads
Valmont
to
declare
that
he
will
seduce
her
to
the
point
that
he
will
become
the
“god
of
her
choice”
(Laclos
Her
piety
and
virtue
are
highlighted
throughout
the
novel
even
in
Valmont
s
later
letters
where
he
calls
her
an
“astonishing”
(Laclos
“tender
hearted
prude”
(Laclos
She
is
also
held
in
high
esteem
by
other
women
such
as
Madame
de
Rosemonde
and
Madame
de
Volanges
who
arranged
Madame
de
Tourvel
s
marriage
The
allusions
to
her
husband
are
restricted
to
the
beginning
of
the
novel
and
it
is
obvious
that
though
Madame
de
Tourvel
holds
him
in
high
esteem
she
is
not
passionate
about
him
In
fact
she
initially
sees
love
as
“dangerous
derangement”
which
would
cause
“frightful
destruction”
(Laclos
and
uses
this
as
reason
to
keep
Valmont
at
bay
Eventually
however
she
stops
resiting
Valmont
and
her
behavior
is
studied
by
the
Marquise
de
Merteuil
who
declares
that
Madame
de
Tourvel
has
Valmont
“by
the
lading
strings
like
child”
(Laclos
It
is
this
statement
by
Merteuil
that
makes
the
reader
doubt
Madame
de
Tourvel
s
apparent
innocence
towards
love
affairs
If
Merteuil
herself
feels
that
Tourvel
woman
who
she
has
considered
barely
more
than
possessing
poor
fashion
sense
believes
that
Tourvel
can
lead
Valmont
on
in
such
way
then
this
just
highlights
small
seemingly
devious
part
of
her
character
that
was
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
Princess
of
Clèves
Madame
de
Tourvel
s
inability
to
resist
Valmont
who
is
decidedly
more
wicked
character
than
the
Duke
de
Nemours
just
emphasizes
weakness
in
her
character
that
made
her
capitulate
to
one
such
as
Valmont
Though
she
is
punished
for
her
adultery
it
is
through
grief
over
Valmont
breaking
with
her
instead
of
any
grief
over
having
deceived
her
husband
that
leads
to
her
death
telling
difference
between
her
character
and
that
of
the
Princess
of
Clèves
In
André
Gide
s
The
Pastoral
Symphony
the
young
Gertrude
also
willingly
enters
into
an
Malik
affair
with
the
pastor
who
took
her
into
his
home
when
she
was
child
Gertrude
is
blind
and
cannot
see
how
old
the
pastor
is
however
this
does
not
allow
the
reader
to
ignore
the
fact
that
Gertrude
is
well
aware
that
the
pastor
is
married
and
that
his
wife
Amélie
is
not
happy
about
Gertrude
being
in
the
house
from
the
day
she
arrived
Gertrude
deliberately
chooses
to
not
see
the
pain
she
is
causing
Amélie
and
this
is
rather
cruel
on
her
part
given
how
perceptive
she
is
about
life
in
general
Gertrude
s
character
does
not
seem
to
be
inherently
corrupt
though
her
young
age
plays
part
in
her
giving
in
to
the
pastor
as
does
the
fact
that
she
primarily
spends
all
her
time
with
him
imagining
him
to
be
young
and
good
looking
like
his
son
Jacques
whom
she
eventually
falls
in
love
with
The
pastor
s
own
behavior
is
more
to
blame
than
Gertrude
s
he
being
the
adult
in
their
relationship
should
have
been
more
aware
of
the
wrong
things
he
was
doing
with
her
In
way
Gertrude
is
probably
the
most
similar
to
the
Princes
of
Clèves
in
that
she
realizes
that
what
she
did
was
wrong
and
against
her
principles
and
so
she
repents
before
her
death
The
Princess
of
Clèves
is
by
far
the
most
virtuous
out
of
all
these
characters
simply
because
her
sense
of
honor
and
duty
did
not
let
her
indulge
in
her
feelings
for
Nemours
Although
Madame
de
Rênal
was
largely
unaware
of
any
wrongdoing
on
her
part
in
the
beginning
she
eventually
stops
caring
about
any
reproach
she
may
inspire
overcome
by
her
feelings
for
Julien
Madame
de
Tourvel
starts
out
fearing
love
just
as
the
Princess
did
but
also
gives
in
to
Valmont
while
Merteuil
s
comment
about
her
makes
it
seems
as
though
she
was
simply
using
her
fear
as
an
excuse
to
both
entice
Valmont
and
keep
him
away
Finally
Gertrude
possessed
some
of
the
principles
that
the
Princess
did
and
once
she
saw
the
pain
she
had
caused
to
those
around
her
she
allowed
herself
to
die
as
way
to
repent
Thus
it
would
appear
that
the
fear
of
love
her

out
into
the
world
and
start
doing
things
we
are
not
supposed
to
do
There
will
always
be
line
we
will
never
be
able
to
cross
because
life
is
all
about
making
the
right
choices
and
following
the
government
rules
because
we
are
not
free
if
we
were
to
be
free
the
government
wouldnt
control
us
just
like
they
do
know
they
cant
leave
us
free
because
there
are
people
that
are
out
of
mind
because
It
depends
on
how
each
person
acts
and
decides
to
make
the
right
choices
There
are
some
people
that
are
not
capable
of
being
free
and
they
make
the
wrong
choices
even
if
each
person
is
responsible
of
their
actions
That
is
why
there
are
rules
that
we
need
to
follow
throughout
our
lifes
thats
what
wil
defind
our
future
being
that
think
we
should
be
limited
in
the
choices
we
can
make
we
should
not
be
free
we
need
to
fight
for
what
we
think
is
good
for
us
personally
think
that
we
would
have
limited
in
the
choices
we
can
make
The
reason
think
this
would
have
be
because
in
life
you
can
not
always
get
what
you
want
you
are
always
limited
to
things
around
you
Sure
you
can
make
some
of
your
decisions
but
not
all;
if
we
were
aloud
to
make
all
of
the
decisions
we
do
there
would
be
alot
of
slip
up
and
accidents
Some
stuff
that
we
do
are
our
responsibility
well
actually
most
stuff
we
do
wrong
are
you
should
give
yourself
limited
choice
to
make
decision
Then
just
coming
up
with
one
thing;
then
something
goes
wrong
and
then
you
really
start
thinking
mabye
should
of
limited
myself
and
thought
everything
through
the
going
for
the
one
thing
decided
on
This
is
why
do
personally
think
there
should
be
limit
on
making
your
own
decisions
Honestly
think
we
should
be
able
to
make
our
own
decisions
because
it
is
our
life
We
can
do
whatever
we
want
with
it
If
we
go
through
rough
obstacles
we
have
to
manage
to
work
them
out
Some
of
us
might
even
be
successful
with
our
decision
or
not
You
chose
your
own
decision
You
should
not
have
to
be
limited
on
your
choices
that
you
make
Some
people
might
not
like
the
fact
that
they
can
not
go
over
certain
amount
of
decisions
they
can
make
One
example
is
you
are
going
to
store
to
buy
some
groceries
You
see
delicious
candy
bar
You
are
not
sure
if
you
should
take
it
It
is
your
own
decision
In
todays
world
we
are
not
limited
on
our
own
decisions
We
can
make
millions
of
decisions
in
life
Maybe
you
should
just
over
think
it
and
make
the
good
decisions
at
least
We
are
responsible
enough
to
make
our
own
decisions
We
should
need
to
have
someone
near
us
telling
you
’
You
have
gone
over
your
limit
of
decisions’
If
you
are
mature
enough
to
do
the
right
things
you
are
old
enough
to
make
your
own
decisions
but
the
good
ones
Yes
some
people
will
choose
the
wrong
the
decision
but
it
was
their
own
choice
am
against
us
people
today
having
to
be
limited
in
the
choices
you
make
agree
that
it
is
better
to
just
be
responsible
and
make
and
choose
your
own
decision
You
are
an
adult
Now
some
people
will
be
totally
against
that
But
am
very
thankful
that
now
the
time
I’m
living
in
we
make
and
choose
our
own
decisions
We
do
not
need
anybody
to
be
telling
us
what
we
can
or
can
not
do
In
conclusion
today
we
do
not
have
to
be
limited
over
the
choices
we
make
We
can
make
and
choose
our
own
decisions
We
are
free
to
make
and
choose
our
own
decisions
We
are
limited
in
the
choices
that
we
can
make
by
number
of
things
First
we
are
restricted
by
our
government
who
sets
rules
that
we
have
to
abide
by
Next
is
our
schools
because
they
set
certain
standard
on
our
classes
and
we
have
to
meet
their
requirements
and
also
we
are
limited
in
our
actions
when
we
are
at
work
Our
government
has
laws
that
we
have
to
go
by
or
we
will
be
fined
or
punished
for
not
abiding
by
them
Hitler
came
up
with
all
sorts
of
rules
and
conditions
and
if
they
weren’t
followed
he
would
have
the
citizen
executed
In
our
school
we
don’t
have
very
much
freedom
in
choicing
which
courses
we
want
to
take
because
we
have
so
many
mandatory
ones
that
has
to
be
taken
in
order
to
get
enough
credits
to
graduate
such
as
years
of
Math
years
English
and
years
of
Reading
and
Writing
And
last
but
not
least
when
you
get
job
nearly
every
employer
has
certain
code
that
you
have
to
go
by
in
order
to
work
for
them
Some
companies
have
started
banning
you
from
bringing
your
bible
to
work
to
read
on
your
break
or
talking
religion
to
your
coworkers
So
all
in
all
think
we
are
limited
in
the
choices
we
can
make
by
our
government
schools
and
our
employers
Each
and
every
person
is
able
to
freely
make
their
own
decisions
This
is
process
that
man
has
been
able
to
do
from
the
very
beginning
With
out
the
chance
of
being
able
to
make
free
decisions
then
as
an
individual
or
as
whole
many
complications
can
start
to
arise
In
my
life
there
has
been
many
choices
that
have
been
made
many
that
were
never
easy
Apart
from
day
to
day
decisions
to
ones
that
could
impact
you
your
friends
your
family
or
just
those
around
you
regardless
of
who
they
may
be
The
decision
that
one
is
able
to
make
can
have
so
many
outcomes
One
day
an
individual
could
help
make
work
center
run
more
efficently
because
they
made
decision
that
would
help
both
themself
and
the
others
around
them
On
the
other
hand
that
same
individual
could
have
just
as
easily
made
completly
different
choice
with
result
could
end
up
lot
worse
for
that
one
person
or
someone
else
Each
and
every
day
there
are
men
and
women
that
freely
choose
to
put
them
selves
in
harms
way
No
one
has
threatened
them
that
they
must
go
do
this
or
else
see
on
daily
Basis
people
that
go
and
put
on
uniform
because
they
chose
to
do
it
Yes
each
person
has
their
own
reason
for
doing
what
they
do
however
each
one
that
does
this
still
does
this
freely
You
may
be
limited
on
your
choices
at
current
time
but
that
could
be
because
of
everything
going
on
around
you
If
we
lived
in
world
ruled
with
limitations
Dicisions
are
endless
it
is
up
to
you
to
make
anything
happen
You
can
come
from
poor
family
and
end
up
billionaire
due
to
the
wise
dicisions
you
made
growing
up
It
can
take
one
mindless
dicision
to
end
your
hopes
of
becoming
something
bigger
You
can
go
from
having
nothing
to
having
it
all
based
on
all
your
successes
in
life
For
example
my
family
does
not
have
lot
of
money
therefore
my
family
is
living
paycheck
to
paycheck
To
make
sure
do
not
live
the
life
of
worrying
like
my
mother
will
pursue
my
dream
of
becoming
doctor
will
make
that
decision
to
change
my
life
for
the
better
If
you
are
caught
up
in
sticky
situation
it
is
because
you
lead
yourself
by
the
choices
you
made
in
You
are
judged
by
others
soley
based
on
your
daily
decisions
therefore
you
are
respondsible
for
your
future
You
are
capable
as
an
adult
to
make
the
best
decisions
and
understand
that
all
things
you
do
in
life
may
come
with
consequence
It
absolutely
can
be
difficult
to
understand
what
the
best
choice
is
for
you
and
if
you
end
up
failing
there
is
always
second
chance
Life
is
all
about
trial
and
error
You
can
test
the
waters
and
see
all
the
different
outcomes
and
choose
the
best
decision
that
fits
you
You
may
not
always
choose
the
right
decision
but
it
can
teach
you
how
to
address
any
situation
in
the
future
Every
decision
you
make
in
life
has
an
effect
not
only
on
yourself
but
others
around
you
You
are
to
think
before
you
react
because
you
can
cause
trouble
between
you
and
your
peers
This
can
be
reason
why
your
decisions
make
up
who
you
are
and
how
others
view
your
characters
You
are
not
limited
to
the
decisions
you
make
because
you
have
full
control
of
your
character
and
how
successful
you
want
your
future
to
be
The
kind
of
life
you
lead
is
completely
in
your
hands
No
one
can
stop
you
from
accomplishing
your
goals
Although
there
might
be
bumbs
along
the
way
you
are
fully
capable
of
going
over
them
As
an
adult
you
are
free
to
make
unlimited
decisions
that
make
you
respondsible
for
choices
and
with
great
decision
making
it
will
showcase
The
writer
vaguely
acknowledges
the
prompt’s
assertion
that
circumstances
such
as
“a
poor
family”
can
define
the
choices
we
make
and
develops
viable
point
of
view
ultimately
rejecting
the
idea
that
circumstances
inhibit
our
choices
(you
have
full
control
of
your
character
and
how
successful
you
want
your
future
to
be)
Competent
critical
thinking
adds
nuance
to
the
position
This
is
particularly
evident
in
the
second
paragraph
which
begins
by
acknowledging
the
difficulty
in
determining
the
best
choice
but
goes
on
to
suggest
that
even
poor
choices
can
equip
one
to
better
deal
with
future
difficulties
The
writer
then
expands
the
topic
by
recognizing
that
one’s
actions
affect
not
only
oneself
but
“others
around
you”
as
well
offering
an
implicit
rejoinder
to
Marino’s
claim
that
our
choices
alone
cannot
determine
“who
you
are
and
how
others
view
your
characters
”
The
response
is
generally
organized
and
exhibits
progression
of
ideas
through
the
use
of
extended
examples
(my
family
does
not
have
lot
of
money
therefore
my
family
is
living
paycheck
to
paycheck
To
make
sure
do
not
live
the
life
of
worrying
like
my
mother
will
pursue
my
dream
of
becoming
doctor
will
make
that
decision
to
change
my
life
for
the
better)
Adequate
control
of
language
is
demonstrated
throughout
the
essay
with
some
varied
sentence
structures
(It
absolutely
can
be
difficult
to
understand
what
the
best
choice
is
for
you
and
if
you
end
up
failing
there
is
always
second
chance
Life
is
all
about
trial
and
error)
This
response
exhibits
adequate
mastery
of
on
demand
essay
writing
and
The
ability
of
decision
making
is
one
of
few
traits
thats
differenciates
us
from
animals
As
opposed
to
most
other
living
specimens
on
this
planet
who
mostly
act
upon
instinct
and
would
appear
to
have
little
to
no
control
over
the
course
of
their
lives
strongly
belive
our
abilty
to
think
critically
has
major
impact
on
we
deicde
to
live
our
lives
But
for
the
question
at
hand
“are
we
free
to
make
our
decisons
or
are
our
choices
limited”
would
have
to
say
yes
to
both
Like
stated
previously
belive
humans
possesion
of
critical
thinking
and
kowing
right
from
wrong
and
so
on
gives
great
ammount
of
control
over
out
lives
Without
which
we
would
be
no
different
than
most
animals
Every
day
we
wake
up
we
make
decision
that
could
impact
the
rest
our
day
or
maybe
even
the
rest
of
out
lives
for
example
what
time
you
should
wake
up
because
if
you’re
late
again
you
will
lose
your
job
Even
the
decions
in
what
we
eat
day
to
day
or
how
much
excerise
we
feel
like
getting
will
impact
our
health
All
of
these
are
situations
we
have
control
over
If
choose
to
smoke
and
end
up
with
cancer
well
thats
my
fault
and
no
one
elses
Ultimately
when
it
comes
down
to
it
the
paths
we
deicde
to
take
in
life
are
choices
that
are
made
by
us
and
us
alone
Despite
being
sentient
species
having
free
will
and
being
able
to
ultimately
control
our
fates
sometimes
the
decions
we
make
can
be
limited
to
what
resources
you
have
available
to
yourself
Perhaps
you
are
child
and
your
parents
are
the
only
resource
you
have
to
accomplish
most
of
anything
you
like
to
go
for
In
that
case
your
parents
might
be
making
lot
of
decions
for
you
as
any
good
parent
would
Mental
dissabilities
unfortunately
can
also
be
factor
when
it
comes
to
persons
thought
process
as
they
attempt
critical
decision
making
We
as
humans
posess
abilities
far
greater
than
many
other
creatures
we
share
the
Earth
with
Some
like
to
think
it
is
up
to
fate
to
decide
how
our
lives
turn
out
and
even
that
is
decision
in
itsself
As
an
intelligent
species
have
total
control
over
our
own
lives
and
what
we
decide
to
do
with
it
regardless
of
what
influences
us
or
what
may
be
available
to
help
us
along
the
way
It’s
easy
to
say
that
we
are
free
to
make
our
own
decisions
but
are
we?
In
my
opinion
yes
we
all
have
free
will
to
make
certain
choices
and
others
not
so
much
There
are
certain
factors
that
can
play
role
in
life
such
as
lifestyles
choices
that
were
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation
without
even
knowing
the
wrong
doing
of
it
Since
it
was
passed
down
it
must
be
normal
right?
Not
always!
There
are
two
very
complicated
choices
to
make
to
do
great
or
not
so
great
ultimately
the
choice
is
yours
This
factor
can
depend
on
your
background
such
as
self
esteem
family
friends
beliefs
and
host
of
others
Not
saying
that
anyone
is
perfect
because
we
all
make
mistakes
but
if
you
want
better
you
will
do
better
Self
esteem
is
the
first
one
Key
word
is
self
but
it
doesn’t
start
with
self
As
child
was
taught
to
be
confident
in
myself
but
grew
up
with
others
that
weren’t
taught
the
same
Some
were
brought
up
in
not
so
great
enviornment
where
they
may
have
been
abused
in
one
way
or
another
and
it
happened
so
much
it
became
their
normal
This
could
throw
your
decision
making
judgement
off
I’m
not
saying
you
can’t
come
from
terrible
background
and
be
better
person
because
it’s
all
about
you
and
what
you
want
out
of
life
Sure
it
may
be
little
tough
compared
to
someone
else
but
know
one
said
it
would
be
easy!
In
my
experience
family
plays
major
role
in
what
you
can
and
will
become
Family
can
build
you
up
but
can
also
tear
you
down
Above
everything
self
is
the
foundation
and
believe
that
if
you
have
very
supportive
background
and
positive
outlook
life
your
choices
you
decide
to
make
will
have
very
positive
outcomes
Even
with
great
family
foundation
it
could
still
be
challenging
to
make
your
own
decisions
because
friends
could
cause
peer
pressure
Peer
pressure
can
cause
one
to
feel
like
they
have
to
do
whatever
it
is
to
be
cool
or
to
even
be
noticed
For
some
this
isn’t
decision
they
would
normally
make
but
to
fit
in
is
the
key
What
they
think
is
normal
seems
to
be
everything
they
want
and
need
at
that
moment
Even
though
they
know
it’s
wrong
they
may
feel
the
need
to
have
the
validation
from
others
Others
aren’t
so
bothered
with
it
Some
may
lack
the
attention
at
home
and
feel
the
need
to
gain
it
elsewhere
Whatever
the
reasoning
peer
pressure
is
real
and
could
affect
the
choices
you
make
Ultimately
you
hold
your
future
in
your
hands
No
matter
how
rough
the
ride
may
be
you
can
make
it!
Every
now
and
then
we
just
may
need
little
reminder
of
how
great
we
are
and
what
we
are
capable
of
becoming
As
always
remember
every
action
has
reaction
whether
good
or
bad
so
be
mindful
of
your
decision
making!
The
decisions
we
make
on
daily
basis
shape
the
type
of
person
we
are
along
with
the
type
of
person
others
see
us
as
when
child
is
young
they
are
guided
and
do
not
have
much
of
say
in
decison
making
however
as
and
individual
gets
older
they
are
expected
to
start
making
their
own
decisions
Decision
making
can
be
complex
for
some
individuals
while
on
the
other
hand
for
some
deciding
what
they
want
is
something
that
comes
naturally
Every
one
makes
different
decisions
and
thus
lead
different
lives
based
on
the
choices
they
take
however
we
are
not
always
free
in
the
choices
we
make
their
is
variety
of
different
components
which
shape
our
ability
to
make
decisions
The
choices
an
individual
makes
on
daily
basis
have
lot
to
do
with
cultural
or
religious
beliefs
different
cultures
have
different
teachings
and
different
outlooks
on
what
is
acceptable
and
what
is
forbidden
Parents
raise
their
children
according
to
the
way
they
think
and
the
type
of
person
they
would
like
their
child
to
become
Many
parents
have
certain
expectations
from
their
children
regarding
the
decisions
they
make
based
on
cultural
beliefs
that
the
parents
or
other
family
members
expect
their
child
to
follow
and
abide
by
The
society
one
lives
in
also
has
huge
impact
on
the
decisons
you
make
individuals
are
expected
to
act
in
certain
ways
in
certain
societies
and
not
doing
so
may
cause
conflicts
Thus
cultural
and
societal
teachings
and
expectations
impact
large
amount
of
our
ability
to
make
choices
and
often
leave
us
with
limited
to
no
choice
at
all
The
circumstances
we
are
in
is
another
factor
which
often
limits
the
decisions
we
make
and
we
do
not
always
have
choice
in
the
circumstances
we
are
put
into
An
example
of
this
is
when
child
is
born
into
very
poor
family
which
hardly
has
enough
food
to
put
on
the
table
they
automatically
are
limited
to
making
many
decisions
in
their
life
such
as
if
they
would
like
to
have
proper
eductation
They
may
not
be
able
to
pursue
their
dreams
of
having
an
education
due
to
the
circumstances
of
their
family
which
may
not
be
able
to
afford
giving
their
child
an
education
at
all
Someone
with
completely
different
circumstances
on
the
other
hand
would
have
completely
different
set
of
choices
in
their
lives
which
would
allow
them
to
make
completely
different
decisions
Laws
and
regulations
have
an
immense
amount
of
control
on
the
decisions
one
can
make
most
of
the
time
there
are
consequences
when
the
law
is
broken
or
bent
In
Canada
we
have
many
rules
and
regulations
which
every
individual
is
suppose
to

There
is
a
stark
difference
between
Protestant
and
Catholic
believers
Many
Protestant
leaders
are
in
the
forefront
of
demanding
ultimate
punishment
Official
Catholic
policy
condemns
the
death
penalty
Perhaps
the
strongest
argument
against
the
death
penalty
is
extreme
bias
against
the
poor
minorities
or
those
with
diminished
mental
capacity
Although
homicide
victims
are
six
times
more
likely
to
be
black
rather
than
white
percent
of
death
penalty
cases
involve
white
victims
Also
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
rich
white
person
going
to
the
death
chamber
after
being
defended
by
expensive
lawyers
This
demonstrates
a
higher
value
placed
on
the
lives
of
white
Americans

That
s

to
answer
because
there
s
already
been
plenty
of
success
with
people

the
way
they
are
today
People
don
t
really
think
about
what
they
don

have
to
offer
but
it
s
reasonable
to
believe
that
if
you
offer
equity
then
a
whole

wave
of
funders
will
come
to

I’m
not
going

discuss
Osi’s
contract
situation
with
you
guys
I
can
say
this
to
you
though:
the
New

Giants
are
a
better
football
team
with
Osi
Umenyiora
on

team
Reese
said
when
Ruocco
asked
him
if
he
has
the
urge
to
throw
(Umenyiora)
a
bone
for
his
years
of
production
We
respect
him
as
a
football
player
Our
goal
is
to
have
Osi
play
football
with
the
New
York
Giants
and
retire
as
a
Giant
That
is
what
we
would
like
to
do
first
All
of
our
options
are
open
as
I
have
said
before

Osi
makes
